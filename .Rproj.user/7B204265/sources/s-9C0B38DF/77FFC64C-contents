# About {-}
This paper reports on the bibliographic research of my thesis on unsupervised classification for longitudinal data and trajectories analysis.

## Objectives
The objective is to synthesise the current state of research related to the topic (what others have done - said - found).

## Definition
unsupervised classification : **Unsupervised classification refers to a set of methods whose objective is to establish or recover an existing typology characterising a set of n observations, from p characteristics measured on each of the observations.**

longitudinal data : **Longitudinal data is a series of repetitive observations of the same topics, collected over a period of time. Longitudinal data varies from cross-sectional data, since it tracks the same subjects over a period of time, whereas cross-sectional data samples different subjects  at every point of time.**

trajectories data :

## Delimitations
We are only interested in unsupervised classification as an analysis method, with this differents terms :

* unsupervised classification

* unsupervised learning

* clustering / partitioning


## Keywords definition
Direct terms :

* unsupervised classification of trajectories

* data unsupervised classification of longitudinal data

Synonymous terms :

* clustering of trajectories

* automatical classification of trajectories 

* clustering of longitudinal data

* automatical classification of longitudinal 

Indirect terms :

* classification of *life*, *health*, *care* pathways

* analysis of longitudinal data

* analysis of trajectories


## Types of information

In the literature review, we are looking for theoretical analyses or examples of applications (longitudinal data, trajectory data, source code)


## The ressources

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pkglist <- data.frame(
  A=c('[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/ "Google Scholar")','[Cairn](https://www.cairn.info/)','[Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)'),
 B=c("Articles académiques","Articles académiques","Articles académiques, Actes de congrès, Résumés de livres"))
knitr::kable(pkglist, col.names = c("Ressource", "Type"), 
             booktabs = TRUE) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```

## Bibliographic review management

1. Do a quick refresh of the list of unsupervised and semi-supervised classification methods.
2. Find articles treating exactly with the subject (reference articles)
3. Extend the reading

* For each article reading, I will summarize it according to : the title, authors,
date and location of article publication, the problem, limits and advantages of the results.

* Then, I will archive it to my account **[mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager)**

* At end, I will do repport (presentation) to Violaine and the team if necessary.
