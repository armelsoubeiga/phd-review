Longitudinal data varies from cross-sectional data, since it tracks the same subjects over a period of time, whereas cross-sectional data samples different subjects at every point of time. trajectories data : 0.3 Delimitations We are only interested in unsupervised classification as an analysis method, with this differents terms : unsupervised classification unsupervised learning clustering / partitioning 0.4 Keywords definition Direct terms : unsupervised classification of trajectories data unsupervised classification of longitudinal data Synonymous terms : clustering of trajectories automatical classification of trajectories clustering of longitudinal data automatical classification of longitudinal Indirect terms : classification of life, health, care pathways analysis of longitudinal data analysis of trajectories 0.5 Types of information In the literature review, we are looking for theoretical analyses or examples of applications (longitudinal data, trajectory data, source code) 0.6 The ressources Ressource Type Google Scholar Articles académiques Cairn Articles académiques Science Direct Articles académiques, Actes de congrès, Résumés de livres 0.7 Bibliographic review management Do a quick refresh of the list of unsupervised and semi-supervised classification methods. Find articles treating exactly with the subject (reference articles) Extend the reading For each article reading, I will summarize it according to : the title, authors, date and location of article publication, the problem, limits and advantages of the results. Then, I will archive it to my account mendeley At end, I will do repport (presentation) to Violaine and the team if necessary.
